    <ul>
      <li><i>All Birds find shelter during a rain.
But Eagle avoids rain by flying above
the Clouds.Problems are common, but attitude
makes the difference!!!</li>
      <li>Don't take rest after your first victory because if you fail in second, more lips are waiting to say that your first victory was just luck.</li>
      <li>For great men, religion is a way of making friends; small people make religion a fighting tool.</li>
      <li>Failure will never overtake me if my definition to succeed is strong enough</li>
      <li>To live only for some unknown future is superficial. It is like climbing a mountain to reach the peak without experiencing its sides. The sides of the mountain sustain life, not the peak. This is where things grow, experience is gained and technologies are mastered. The importance of the peak lies only in the fact that it defines the sides.</i></li>
